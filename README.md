## Overview

This project recreates the Fylo dark theme landing page using HTML and CSS.


### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page


## My process

-Initialized the project as a github repository.

-Analysed the layout and design of the landing page and structed the HTML page accordindly.

-Designed and sytled each section one after the other.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

I learned how to assing custom css code to variables. I also learned how to use media queries to make the page responsive on all fronts.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


```css
@media (max-width: 1000px) {
    header {
        padding: var(--padding-sm);
    }
    header img,
    footer img {
        width: 115px;
        height: auto;
    }
```

### Continued development

I would love to learn more about media queries. I also would want to dive further into css styles.
